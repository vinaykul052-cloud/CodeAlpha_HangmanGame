# CodeAlpha Internship Tasks

Welcome to my CodeAlpha Internship repository. This repository contains the Python projects.I completed as part of my internship tasks. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file with clear instructions and outputs.

## Task 1: Hangman Game
- **Description:** Classic hangman game implemented in Python. The user tries to guess the hidden word by entering letters, with a limited number of attempts.
- **File:** `task1_hangman.py`
- **Concepts Used:** Loops, Strings, Conditional Statements, Input/Output
- **How to Run:**  
  1. Open `task1_hangman.py` in Python environment.  
  2. Run the code and follow the on-screen instructions to guess the word.

## Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
- **Description:** A simple stock tracker that calculates the total investment based on user input. Users enter stock names and quantities, and the program uses hardcoded stock prices to compute the total value. Optionally, the result can be saved to a `.txt` file.
- **File:** `task2_stock_tracker.py`
- **Concepts Used:** Dictionary, Loops, Input/Output, Basic Arithmetic, File Handling (optional)
- **How to Run:**  
  1. Open `task2_stock_tracker.py` in Python environment.  
  2. Run the code and follow the on-screen instructions to enter stock names and quantities.  
  3. After finishing, the total investment will be displayed and optionally saved to `portfolio.txt`.

## Task 4: Basic Chatbot
- **Description:** A simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The user can type basic messages like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, or `"bye"`, and the chatbot responds with predefined replies. The chat continues until the user types `"exit"`.
- **File:** `task4_basic_chatbot.py`
- **Concepts Used:** If-elif-else statements, Functions, Loops, Input/Output
- **How to Run:**  
  1. Open `task4_basic_chatbot.py` in Python environment.  
  2. Run the code and interact with the chatbot by typing messages like `"hello"`, `"how are you"`, or `"bye"`.  
  3. Type `"exit"` to end the chat.
