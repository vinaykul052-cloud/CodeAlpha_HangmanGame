Welcome to my CodeAlpha Internship repository. This repository contains the Python projects I completed as part of my internship tasks. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file with clear instructions and outputs.

- **File:** `task2_stock_tracker.py`
- **Concepts Used:** Dictionary, Loops, Input/Output, Basic Arithmetic, File Handling (optional)
- **How to Run:**  
  1. Open `task2_stock_tracker.py` in Python environment.  
  2. Run the code and follow the on-screen instructions to enter stock names and quantities.  
  3. After finishing, the total investment will be displayed and optionally saved to `portfolio.txt`.
